# Portfolio Website Migration

## Project Overview
This is a portfolio website that was migrated from Bolt to Replit environment. It showcases full-stack development capabilities, featuring an animated React frontend with backend infrastructure.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite for build tooling
- **Backend**: Express.js server serving both API and static files
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations using Framer Motion
- **Routing**: Single-page application with smooth scrolling

## Recent Changes
- **2024-07-21**: Migrated from Bolt to Replit
  - Fixed CSS import order issues (Google Fonts must come before Tailwind directives)
  - Updated React components to modern patterns (removed unnecessary React imports)
  - Server running on port 5000 as required by Replit
  - Hot module replacement working correctly
  - Enhanced text readability by darkening background image overlay (changed from white/60% to black/40%)

## Migration Status
- [x] Package installation verified
- [x] CSS import order fixed
- [x] React components modernized
- [x] Server configuration adapted for Replit
- [ ] Final verification and deployment ready

## Technical Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Express.js backend
- Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- Vite development server
- Drizzle ORM (configured but not actively used)

## Known Issues
- Minor TypeScript warning in server/vite.ts (protected file, not affecting functionality)
- Server serves on port 5000 as required by Replit environment
